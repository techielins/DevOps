#Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
#This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year. 

#> `on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#>   **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#>     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400`

#e.g. The year 2000:

#2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)

#2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

#2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)

#So the year 2000 is a leap year.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
   if year % 400 == 0:
     print("Leap year")
   else:
     print("not a leap year")
  else:
   print("Leap year")

else:
  print("Not leap year")
